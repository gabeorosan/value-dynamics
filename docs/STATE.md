# STATE — shared dashboard for all threads

Read this first in every session. Keep it a dashboard, not an archive: one-liners
with pointers into docs/, never pasted content. Update your thread's section and
"Recent changes" when a unit of work lands, then commit and push. Pull before
starting a work chunk.

## Thread lanes (who owns what)

| Thread | Owns (writes) | Everything else |
|---|---|---|
| Figures | docs/figures/ | read-only |
| Lit & planning | docs/plan_*.md, docs/lit_review_*.md | read-only |
| Experiment specs | experiments/ (new dirs; one dir per experiment) | read-only |
| Analysis (runs, monitoring, reports) | experiments/*/output/, docs/report_*.md, this file's "Jobs" table | read-only |
| General | anything cross-lane or unowned; resolves "Requests between threads" | — |

Cross-lane edits: leave a note under "Requests between threads" instead of editing
another lane's files.

## Headline results (stable; details in the linked docs)

- Judge identity switches the dynamics: self-judge → divergent basins (15 seeds end
  0.03–0.81), frozen base judge → uniform decay (8/8). docs/report_basin_anchor.md, fig2.
- Format gates transfer: selection on bold prose makes fresh prose score bolder each
  round (0.47→0.64) but never moves gamble choices; the same rule on A/B-choice data
  runs away to 1.0. fig10, fig6.
- Rhetoric dissociates channels: concessive refutation flips ratings but not choices;
  hedged advocacy lifts choices but not ratings. docs/report_stance_dissociation.md, fig3.
- Off-target drift is three phenomena: content-free (corrigibility falls 16/16),
  content-coupled (optimism), optimizer-idiosyncratic (risk, agreeableness). fig9.
- Dose adds run-to-run rating spread, not effect; fresh sampling prevents the entropy
  collapse that verbatim self-data causes. fig7, fig8.

## Jobs

| Job | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Regime grid (62 cells, ρ × judge) | Modal | WAITING on spend cap; relaunch: `modal run --detach modal_app.py::grid` in experiments/modal/modal_regime_map/ |
| Basin ensembles (seeds 0–14) | Kaggle | DONE — pulled, in fig2 |
| Qwen basin seeds 15–30 (Job 1) | Lightning | READY for user to start (experiments/lightning/README.md) |
| OLMo-3-7B replication (Job 2) | Lightning | READY for user to start |
| EM organism loop | Colab | READY — bootstrap cell with user (experiments/colab/colab_em_loop.py) |
| Frozen-judge re-score of bold-prose samples | Colab | READY (experiments/colab/colab_frozen_judge_rescore.py) |
| Frozen-copy-of-round-0 judge; EM ensembles; dense transition seeds | Kaggle | PLANNED for Saturday 45 h window |
| External-data content arms; dose schedule control | Colab | PLANNED (plan Q5 / fig12) |

## Pending decisions / blockers

- Modal spend cap: user raises it when credits land, then launch grid.
- Battery patch (experiments/common/battery_patch.py) not yet spliced into the
  basin/EM scripts — should go in before the Saturday Kaggle window.

## Requests between threads

- (none)

## Recent changes

- 2026-07-08 basin-anchor-ext (seeds 8–14) pulled; fig2 now n=15; r(round1→final)=0.32.
- 2026-07-08 v3 rollouts re-analyzed: field boldness rises every round while choices
  stay flat; fig10 rebuilt; frozen-judge re-score Colab script written.
- 2026-07-08 battery_patch.py written (judgment taste, identity, self-recognition,
  introspection, wishful thinking, suggestibility).
- 2026-07-08 fig9 redone as small multiples; fig11 (research goal) and fig12
  (experiment map) added.
